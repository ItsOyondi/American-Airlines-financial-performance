**Topic: An analysis of American Airlines Traffic, Capacity and Revenue data by Operating Region between 1995 - 2020.**
### Objectives

1. To determine which of the operating regions has been profitable for America Airlines.
To achieve this task, we first created two line charts for revenue and expenses for all the five operating regions. The line charts covered the period between 1995 and 2020 as shown below.

Fig 2. AA financial performance  - Expenses

Based on the above visualizations, we notable that AAâ€™s profitability has not been constant across all the regions. For instance, the profits between 2015 and 2019, domestic flights were leading in profitability, but between 2019 and 2020, the company experienced notable losses in domestic flights while most of its revenue emerged from international and Latin America regions.

To identify the most profitable region, my analysis was based on the variations (in revenue and expenses) across all the years. This is because, although domestic flights recorded the highest revenue throughout all the years, the expenses were positively correlated with revenue, suggesting that the profits generated might be lower. As a result, i created an area chart that showing the amount of variations (in a negative and positive scale). The bigger the area size, the more the variation. Fig. 3 below shows the final visualization.

Fig 3. AA profitability per region (between 1995 and 2020)

From the visualization, it is notable that Latin America did not experience significant losses and the profit chart was on the positive side and even increased more towards 2020 when domestic flights recorded drastic losses. Therefore, it was concluded that Latin America the most profitable operating region for American Airlines.

3. To establish the relationship between  revenue and operating expenses. This objective was crucial to extract information on how American Airlines were spending with respect to their revenue. Fig. 4 below shows the trend lines for expenses and revenue line charts.

Fig 4. AA financial performance (expenses and revenue). 

From the above visualization, it is notable that although the revenue and expenses are not equal, there was a significant correlation. AA's management seems to have had a flexible expenditure plan that was adjusted as the revenue drops or increases. 

Further analysis will focus on this objective: To establish the year in which American Airlines had the highest and lowest available passenger seats per region.
